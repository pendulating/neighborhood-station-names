This guide will show you some helpful tips for debugging your mods during development.

## Hot Reload

The fastest way to test changes is hot reloading. After rebuilding your mod:

- Press **Ctrl+Shift+R** (or **Cmd+Shift+R** on Mac) in-game
- This calls `api.reloadMods()` internally, which clears all mod callbacks, UI components, custom layers, and custom train types, then re-executes all mod scripts

If you're using `pnpm dev`, Vite automatically rebuilds on file save, so you just need to press the reload shortcut in-game.

> [!NOTE]
> Hot reload clears most mod state, but some things persist (like already-built tracks and stations). If your mod gets into a weird state, restarting the game fully is the safest reset.

## Console Logging

Use `console.log` with a tag prefix to identify your mod's output:

```ts
const TAG = "[MyMod]";
console.log(`${TAG} Initialized`);
console.warn(`${TAG} Something unexpected`, someData);
console.error(`${TAG} Failed to load`, error);
```

### Viewing Logs

When in-game, open the developer console with **Ctrl+Shift+I** (or **Cmd+Option+I** on Mac). With `pnpm dev`, logs are printed to your terminal and saved to `debug/latest.log`. The game launcher enables Electron logging automatically.

---

## Checking Performance

You can monitor the effects of your mod on game performance by pressing **Ctrl+Shift+P** (or **Cmd+Shift+P** on Mac) to view the performance monitor in-game. Run benchmarks while your mod is active to compare frame rates and memory usage.

## Error Handling

Wrap your initialization in try/catch to avoid crashing the game:

```ts
api.hooks.onMapReady((_map) => {
  if (initialized) return;
  initialized = true;
 
  try {
    // Setup code
    console.log(`${TAG} Initialized successfully.`);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(`${TAG} Failed to initialize:`, err);
    api.ui.showNotification("My Mod failed to load. Check console.", "error");
  }
});
```

For hooks that run repeatedly, consider wrapping each callback:

```ts
api.hooks.onDayChange((day) => {
  try {
    // Your logic
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(`${TAG} Error on day ${day}:`, err);
  }
});
```

---

## Game Error Hooks

The API provides hooks for catching game-level warnings and errors:

```ts
api.hooks.onWarning((message) => {
  console.warn(`${TAG} Game warning:`, message);
});
 
api.hooks.onError((error) => {
  console.error(`${TAG} Game error:`, error);
});
```

---

## Type Checking

Run TypeScript's type checker to catch errors before building:

```bash
pnpm typecheck
```

This runs `tsc --noEmit` and reports any type errors without producing output files. It's a good practice to run this before testing in-game.

## Common Issues

### "SubwayBuilderAPI Not Found"

This means your mod script ran before the game initialized the API. This shouldn't happen with the template's structure, but if it does:

- Make sure `main` in `manifest.json` is `index.js`
- Make sure you're checking `if (!api)` before using the API

### UI Not Showing Up

- Check that you're registering UI inside `onMapReady`; the UI system isn't ready before the map loads
- Verify your component doesn't throw during render (check console for React errors)
- Make sure the `id` you're using is unique; duplicate IDs silently fail

### Changes Not Appearing After Reload

- Verify Vite rebuilt successfully (check terminal for build errors)
- Make sure the symlink is still intact (`pnpm dev:link`)
- Try a full game restart if hot reload isn't picking up changes

### React Hooks Errors ("Invalid Hook Call")

This usually means there are multiple React instances. Make sure:

- You're importing from `'react'` (not installing react as a dependency)
- The Vite alias in `vite.config.ts` is correctly pointing to `src/types/react.ts`
- You haven't accidentally installed `react` in `node_modules`

### Windows Symlink Permission Error

On Windows, creating symlinks may require Administrator privileges. Either:

- Run your terminal as Administrator
- Enable Developer Mode in Windows Settings (Settings > For Developers > Developer Mode)
